        The term CLS can refer to several concepts depending on the context, but here are a few common meanings:

        1. Cumulative Layout Shift (Web Development)
        CLS stands for Cumulative Layout Shift, and it's a metric used in web performance to measure visual stability. It is part of Core Web Vitals, which are a set of performance indicators provided by Google to ensure a good user experience on the web.
        Cumulative Layout Shift measures how much the content on a page moves around while it is loading, which can be annoying for users. A high CLS score means that the page content is shifting a lot during the page load, which can disrupt reading or interaction.
        How is CLS measured?
        It calculates the sum of all layout shifts on the page during its lifetime.
        Each shift is weighted by the fraction of the viewport affected by the shift.
        What causes high CLS?
        Images or ads that are inserted without reserved space.
        Font loading issues that change the layout of text.
        Dynamic content loading that affects page layout unexpectedly.
        Good CLS score: A CLS score of less than 0.1 is considered good. A score higher than 0.25 is considered poor.
        2. Class in Programming (particularly in Python)
        In object-oriented programming (OOP), CLS is sometimes used as an abbreviation for Class. A class in programming defines a blueprint for creating objects (instances), providing initial values (attributes), and methods (functions) that operate on the data.
